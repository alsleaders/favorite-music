      "album": "The Book was Better",
      "about": "The Doubleclicks are a nerd-folk duo from Portland, Oregon who write songs that are all at once snarky, geeky, and sweet.  Do you want a band that has a song about shark-eating prehistoric badasses?  Here you go!  The once released an entire album of meows.  They are not sorry."

      "album": "Incongruent",
      "about": "Hank Green does many things. Just lots. You'd be shocked by the number of things he seems to get into. He is supposed to be writing a book, so he puts out fewer songs now. He wrote a song about quarks."

      "image": "../images/Frank.jpg",
      "album": "Be More Kind",
      "about": "You know how you let Youtube autoplay and sometimes you get a bunch of stuff from the same artist and then you happen upon your new favorite song? That's how I found out Frank Turner was truly awesome. He is an English punk and folk singer-songwriter and I really should find a good end to this sentence."
